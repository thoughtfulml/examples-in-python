guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things . she lists ingredients , but never mixes and stirs . 
to imagine the life of harry potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized woody allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is kung pow : enter the fist . 
credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter .

a battle between bug-eye theatre and dead-eye matinee . 
 . . . instead go rent " shakes the clown " , a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great robin williams performance . 
it's the kind of movie that ends up festooning u . s . art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it's in french ( well , mostly ) with english subtitles and is magically 'significant' because of that .

nothing plot-wise is worth e-mailing home about . 
helmer devito . . . attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids' tv and revenge . 
i hated every minute of it . 
obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of hey arnold ! the movie will reach far beyond its core demographic . 
a simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within . 
there is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt seagal's character . . . performs is shot from behind , as if it could fool us into thinking that we're not watching a double .

pumpkin sits in a patch somewhere between mirthless todd solondzian satire and callow student film . 
it's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it isn't . it's just incredibly dull . 
a cumbersome and cliche-ridden movie greased with every emotional device known to man . 
egoyan's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious . 
despite apparent motives to the contrary , it ends up being , like [seinfeld's] revered tv show , about pretty much nothing .

you'll have more fun setting fire to yourself in the parking lot . you'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus . 
ritchie's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people's faces to the fact amber is such a joke . 
little more than a frothy vanity project . 
verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action , tedium for thrills .

it's tough , astringent , darkly funny and . . . well , it's also generic , untidy , condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning . 
there's no denying the elaborateness of the artist's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity . 
there's plenty of style in guillermo del toro's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply can't sustain more than 90 minutes .

not even the hanson brothers can save it
 . . . [a] strained comedy that jettisons all opportunities for rock to make his mark by serving up the usual chaotic nonsense . 
feels like one of those contrived , only-in -hollywood productions where name actors deliver big performances created for the sole purpose of generating oscar talk . 
it tells more than it shows . 
the film might have been more satisfying if it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles . 
not every animated film from disney will become a classic , but forgive me if i've come to expect more from this studio than some 79-minute after-school " cartoon " .

neither funny nor suspenseful nor particularly well-drawn . 
acting , particularly by tambor , almost makes " never again " worthwhile , but [writer/director] schaeffer should follow his titular advice

a dreary , incoherent , self-indulgent mess of a movie in which a bunch of pompous windbags drone on inanely for two hours . . . a cacophony of pretentious , meaningless prattle . 
as conceived by mr . schaeffer , christopher and grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell . 
the essential problem in orange county is that , having created an unusually vivid set of characters worthy of its strong cast , the film flounders when it comes to giving them something to do . 
there is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false .

though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work . 
wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly ( like one of hubert's punches ) , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn .

aspires for the piquant but only really achieves a sort of ridiculous sourness . 
for all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative , the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale . 
one groan-inducing familiarity begets another . 
feeble comedy .

never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful . 
oedekerk wrote patch adams , for which he should not be forgiven . why he was given free reign over this project -- he wrote , directed , starred and produced -- is beyond me .

 . . . too slow , too boring , and occasionally annoying . 
faultlessly professional but finally slight .

a ponderous meditation on love that feels significantly longer than its relatively scant 97 minutes . 
a little too pat for its own good . 
watching trouble every day , at least if you don't know what's coming , is like biting into what looks like a juicy , delicious plum on a hot summer day and coming away with your mouth full of rotten pulp and living worms . 
what would jesus do if he was a film director ? he'd create a movie better than this . 
it's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject , but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history , or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story . 
diane lane shines in unfaithful . almost everything else is wan . 
so relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something . 
the makers of divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood should offer a free ticket ( second prize , of course , two free tickets ) to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie .

the film's implicit premise is that the faith of the tonga people is in every way inferior to that of john . 
you've already seen heartbreak if you've watched the far superior nurse betty or sunset boulevard . even the unwatchable soapdish is more original . 
a journey that's too random and inconclusive to be compelling , but which hoffman's brilliance almost makes worth taking .

feel bad for king , who's honestly trying , and schwartzman , who's shot himself in the foot . 
sometimes , fond memories should stay in the past : a lesson this film teaches all too well . 
shallow . 
a monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it . 
the reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone . 
in the second half of the film , frei's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives nachtwey for self-analysis . 
the furious coherence that [deniro] brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing . 
we never really feel involved with the story , as all of its ideas remain just that : abstract ideas . 
one minute , you think you're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it's as though clips from the pink panther strikes again and/or sailor moon have been spliced in . 
we may never think of band camp as a geeky or nerdy thing again . 
the result is solemn and horrifying , yet strangely detached . 
a less-than-thrilling thriller . 
matthew mcconaughey tries , and fails , to control the screen with swaggering machismo and over-the-top lunacy . 
everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones . 
its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent dumas botch-jobs , the man in the iron mask and the musketeer . 
the plot grinds on with yawn-provoking dullness . 
it doesn't help that the director and cinematographer stephen kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel . 
this film's relationship to actual tension is the same as what christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation . 
director dirk shafer and co-writer greg hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama . 
as [the characters] get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound . 
though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter . 
the fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious . 
all this turns out to be neither funny nor provocative - only dull . 
this idea has lost its originality . . . and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture . 
the film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime , one that brings military courtroom dramas down very , very low . 
a turgid little history lesson , humourless and dull . 
if kaufman kept cameron diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he'd have them mate . 
it would be hard to think of a recent movie that has worked this hard to achieve this little fun . 
all that ( powerpuff girls ) charm is present in the movie , but it's spread too thin . 
the ill-conceived modern-day ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch . 
dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it doesn't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding . 
a great idea becomes a not-great movie . 
by the end , i was looking for something hard with which to bludgeon myself unconscious . 
feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention . 
made by jackasses for jackasses . 
the picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn . 
disjointed parody . 
a bravura exercise in emptiness . 
despite the premise of a good story . . . it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles . 
not only does the movie fail to make us part of its reality , it fails the most basic relevancy test as well . 
this goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring
even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame . 
sunshine state lacks the kind of dynamic that limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece . 
a long-winded , predictable scenario . 
 . . . silly humbuggery . . . 
too clunky and too busy ribbing itself to be truly entertaining . 
it smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original . 
at the bottom rung of the series' entries . 
a dreary rip-off of goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive cautionary tale for hispanic americans . 
good for a few unintentional laughs , " extreme ops " was obviously made for the " xxx " crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction . 
a frustrating combination of strained humor and heavy-handed sentimentality . 
as written by michael berg and michael j . wilson from a story by wilson , this relentless , all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all . 
just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos . 
 . . . the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex , outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs . 
if you're looking for comedy to be served up , better look elsewhere . 
an instant candidate for worst movie of the year . 
like a tone-deaf singer at a benefit concert , john q . is a bad movie appearing on behalf of a good cause . 
what kids will discover is a new collectible . what parents will suspect is that they're watching a 76-minute commercial . 
without september 11 , collateral damage would have been just another bad movie . now it's a bad , embarrassing movie . 
there's a disturbing 'great white hope' undertone to the other side of heaven that subtly undermines its message of christian love and compassion . 
the attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven . 
too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes . 
unfortunately , heartbreak hospital wants to convey the same kind of haughtiness in its own sketchy material but this territory has already been explored previously with better aplomb and sardonic wit . 
[it's] difficult to get beyond the overall blandness of american chai , despite its likable performances and refreshingly naive point of view . 
taken purely as an exercise in style , this oppressively gloomy techno-horror clambake is impossible to ignore . but as a movie , it's a humorless , disjointed mess . 
the backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense . 
overly stylized with lots of flash black-&-white freeze frames reminiscent of a pseudo-hip luxury car commercial , ( it's ) at its worst when it's actually inside the ring . 
if this is satire , it's the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook .

it doesn't quite work , but there's enough here to make us look forward to the russos' next offering . 
the director's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship ( most notably wretched sound design ) . 
apparently kissing leads to suicide attempts and tragic deaths . marisa tomei is good , but just a kiss is just a mess . 
the noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in sorority boys , whose makers apparently believe that women's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting , writing or direction . 
too simple for its own good . 
a chaotic panorama that's too busy flying a lot of metaphoric flags . 
the screenplay sabotages the movie's strengths at almost every juncture . all the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable . 
newcomer helmer kevin donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept – a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman . 
often silly – and gross – but it's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films . 
it's exactly what you'd expect . 
a subtle variation on i spit on your grave in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men . 
as tweedy talks about canning his stockbroker and repairing his pool , you yearn for a few airborne tv sets or nude groupies on the nod to liven things up . 
the best you can say about it is it's so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now . 
an overstuffed compendium of teen-catholic-movie dogma . 
ben affleck as jack ryan , tom clancy's intrepid hero ? ridiculous . what's next ? d . j . qualls as indiana jones ? or tom green as han solo ? 
the movie's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension . 
if this is the resurrection of the halloween franchise , it would have been better off dead . 
i saw knockaround guys yesterday , and already the details have faded like photographs from the spanish-american war . . . it's so unmemorable that it turned my ballpoint notes to invisible ink . 
the average local news columnist has a bigger rant on the war between modern landscape architecture and small-town america . 
the plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset .

the title's lameness should clue you in on how bad the movie is . 
while the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an american movie might demand , scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a hollywood production .

lanie's professional success means she must be a failure at life , because she's driven by ambition and doesn't know how to have fun . 
denzel washington's efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony . 
so faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban , not-quite-suburban milieu as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check . 
there's an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent . 
an awkward and indigestible movie . 
haneke keeps us at arm's length . guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens . 
like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness . 
message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ? alas , it's neither . 
'dragonfly' is a movie about a bus wreck that turns into a film wreck . 
heavy-handed exercise in time-vaulting literary pretension . 
a thinly veiled excuse for wilson to play his self-deprecating act against murphy's well-honed prima donna shtick . 
the movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark . 
it will come as no surprise that the movie isn't scary . but here's the real damn : it isn't funny , either . 
the reason i found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory . 
cho's fans are sure to be entertained ; it's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- i'm not one of them . 
the period -- swinging london in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in gangster no . 1 , but falls apart long before the end . 
the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there's still a real sense that the star trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction . 
i didn't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot . 
with danilo donati's witty designs and dante spinotti's luscious cinematography , this might have made a decent children's movie -- if only benigni hadn't insisted on casting himself in the title role . 
though it draws several decent laughs , it's low-cal woody at best . 
britney's performance cannot be faulted . lucy's a dull girl , that's all . 
well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons . 
if melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna . 
just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story . or a profit . or some damn thing . 
enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment . 
a restrained ribisi convinces as an italian , though if ever a movie needed one of the actor's whiny jags to pump it up , this has to be among the rare ones . 
a hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face . 
the problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , mr . desplechin is content to state it . 
even the imaginative gore can't hide the musty scent of todd farmer's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship . 
the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life . but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored . 
don't let your festive spirit go this far . 
hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it's heading . 
sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary . 
 . . . perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world . 
i'd give real money to see the perpetrators of chicago torn apart by dingoes . 
the timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off . 
a fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy . 
even if you feel like you've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to belushi's easy-going likableness . 
despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy . 
a recipe for cinematic disaster . . . part quentin tarantino , part guy ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it's all bad . 
another big , dumb action movie in the vein of xxx , the transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black bmw through .

well before it's over , beijing bicycle begins spinning its wheels . 
[nelson's] movie about morally compromised figures leaves viewers feeling compromised , unable to find their way out of the fog and the ashes . 
looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due . 
abandons all pretense of creating historical context and waltzes off into a hectic soap about the ups and downs of the heavy breathing between the two artists . 
filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low . fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water . 
the issue of faith is not explored very deeply
the situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels . 
i was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness . 
a very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale . . . a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more . 
black-and-white and unrealistic . 
feels less like it's about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers . 
a standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas . 
it's badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school . 
this film , starring anthony hopkins and chris rock , is your typical 'fish out of water' story . you've seen them a million times . just one problem : fish out of water usually die . this one does . 
a soggy , shapeless mess . . . just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie . 
a combination of standard , stiff tv-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move . 
say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue . 
instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , hart's war , like the st . louis rams in the super bowl , waits until after halftime to get started . 
a gob of drivel so sickly sweet , even the eager consumers of moore's pasteurized ditties will retch it up like rancid crème brûlée . 
never quite transcends jokester status . . . and the punchline doesn't live up to barry's dead-eyed , perfectly chilled delivery . 
it almost plays like solaris , but with guns and jokes . 
it won't be long before you'll spy i spy at a video store near you . 
propelled not by characters but by caricatures . 
this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long . 
the pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film can't help but go soft and stinky . 
a predictable and stereotypical little b-movie . 
frustratingly , dridi tells us nothing about el gallo other than what emerges through his music . 
stephen earnhart's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition – wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text – when it's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type . 
undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters . 
the sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap . 
the plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television- caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy . 
a whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness . 
jolie's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips . 
static , repetitive , muddy and blurry , hey arnold ! would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year . 
un thriller manqué qui tombe sur les nerfs presque dès la première image . 
what the four feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about . 
yes , 4ever is harmless in the extreme and it'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to spirited away ? 
calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it's more like entertainment for trolls . 
 . . . just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise . 
splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers' puppet strings . 
will only satisfy those who can't tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly . 
at times , however , dogtown and z-boys lapses into an insider's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about . 
screenwriters scott abbott and michael petroni have turned rice's complex akasha into a cartoon monster . 
bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description . 
most of the action setups are incoherent . 
 . . . surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs . 
dreary , highly annoying . . . 'some body' will appeal to no one . 
there's something deeply creepy about never again , a new arrow in schaeffer's quiver of ineptitudes . 
a painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots . 
the cartoon that isn't really good enough to be on afternoon tv is now a movie that isn't really good enough to be in theaters . 
this pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film's producers would be in the clink for life . 
if this is the danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps . 
only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry . 
[two] fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable scandinavian settlers in 18th-century canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now . 
the central story lacks punch . 
this may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer's coming-of-age . 
a harmless and mildly amusing family comedy . 
the kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion . 
sucking all the 'classic' out of robert louis stevenson's treasure island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and disney-fied adolescent angst . . . 
while super troopers is above academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling . 
the low-budget full frontal was one of the year's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and solaris is its big-budget brother . 
the film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future quentin tarantino picture
apallingly absurd . . . the chemistry or lack thereof between newton and wahlberg could turn an imax theater into a 9 " black and white portable tv . 
the smug , oily demeanor that donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named pipe dream is just repulsive . 
despite its good nature and some genuinely funny moments , super troopers suffers from a bad case of arrested development . 
i watched the brainless insanity of no such thing with mounting disbelief . 
kwan makes the mix-and- match metaphors intriguing , while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action . 
any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes . like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it . 
has all the poignancy of a hallmark card and all the comedy of a gallagher stand-up act . 
fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense . 
a semi-autobiographical film that's so sloppily written and cast that you cannot believe anyone more central to the creation of bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it . 
the film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other . 
it's the kind of movie you can't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you can't bring yourself to dislike it . 
a graceless , witless attempt at mating some like it hot with the wwii espionage thriller . 
based on a david leavitt story , the film shares that writer's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness . 
to enjoy this movie's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by jolie and burns , you have to gloss over the no sense ending . 
this is a great subject for a movie , but hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director john woo has built his career on . 
overall , the film misses the brilliance of jelinek's novel by some way . it settles for being merely grim . 
it's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie . no , it's the repetition of said behavior , and so children of the century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else . 
just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after ( or during ) consumption of its second half . 
this isn't a " friday " worth waiting for .

its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops . 
a mostly tired retread of several other mob tales . 
nothing about it fits . 
somehow we're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become g . i . jane . 
consider the title's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept . 
the film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in chinese history : war , revolution , communism , etc . 
ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , 'what's the point ? '
the film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but wasn't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing . 
once the audience figure out what's being said , the filmmaker's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care . 
it seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less . 
even by dumb action-movie standards , ballistic : ecks vs . sever is a dumb action movie . 
just a bloody mess . 
martin scorsese cria um espetáculo visual que não possui alma - um filme esteticamente belo , mas emocionalmente frio . 
has something to say . . . but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller . 
as is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions , the film is less poetic than simply pretentious . 
for a film about two mismatched buddies , crystal and de niro share little screen time and even less chemistry . 
extreme oops - oops , ops , no matter how you spell it , it's still a mistake to go see it . 
what will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 . 
a morality tale whose thought-provoking potential is hampered by a made-for-tv look , rigid performances and an asinine 'twist' that brazenly rips off the sixth sense . 
eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work . but even a hero can stumble sometimes . 
it's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you're more than six years old . 
[u]nrelentingly stupid . 
lacking gravitas , macdowell is a placeholder for grief , and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel . leave these flowers unpicked -- they're dead on the vine . 
a shambles of a movie--visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly . . . its hilarity is completely unintentional . 
no , it's not nearly as good as any of its influences . 
the rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it's more comedy than suspense de palma creates . 
city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : it's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes . but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing . 
what could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy-handed melodrama . 
drives for the same kind of bittersweet , conciliatory tone that three seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality . 
the whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit . 
it will probably prove interesting to ram dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture .

fans of the tv series will be disappointed , and everyone else will be slightly bored .

i spy is an embarrassment , a monotonous , disjointed jumble of borrowed plot points and situations . it's as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun . 
afraid to pitch into farce , yet only half-hearted in its spy mechanics , all the queen's men is finally just one long drag . 
maybe it's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages , but something aboul " full frontal " seems , well , contrived . 
the movie is obviously a labour of love so howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted . 
safe conduct , however ambitious and well-intentioned , fails to hit the entertainment bull's-eye . 
too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century . 
it's too long , too repetitive , and takes way too many years to resolve to be a total winner . 
a movie that tries to fuse the two 'woods' but winds up a bolly-holly masala mess . 
leaves you with a knot in your stomach , its power is undercut by its own head-banging obviousness . 
unfortunately , as a writer , mr . montias isn't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor . 
the only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy , jovial team . 
 . . . this movie has a glossy coat of action movie excess while remaining heartless at its core . 
the film is surprisingly well-directed by brett ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act . 
[sen's] soap opera-ish approach undermines his good intentions . 
sushi for the connoisseurs of the macabre . 
though certainly original in form , altar boys requires a taste for swamp thing-type animation , doubled with a deafening score . 
there's not enough to sustain the comedy . 
we may get the full visceral impact of a ruthless army on the warpath but no sense of the devilish complexity of the balkans conflict .

this film is full of rabbits . brimful . but like most rabbits , it seems to lack substance . 
i kept wishing i was watching a documentary about the wartime navajos and what they accomplished instead of all this specious hollywood hoo-ha . 
a movie far more cynical and lazy than anything a fictitious charlie kaufman might object to . 
if high crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title . 
the movie makes absolutely no sense . its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ? 
despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style .

schnieder bounces around with limp wrists , wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers , twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that's enough to sustain laughs . . . 
by the final whistle you're convinced that this mean machine was a decent tv outing that just doesn't have big screen magic . 
a film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun . 
some fine acting , but ultimately a movie with no reason for being . 
a waterlogged version of 'fatal attraction' for the teeny-bopper set . . . a sad , soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads . 
sweet gentle jesus , did the screenwriters just do a cut-and-paste of every bad action-movie line in history ? 
this is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm . 
even on its own ludicrous terms , the sum of all fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the ryan series . 
as predictable as the outcome of a globetrotters-generals game , juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved . 
where tom green stages his gags as assaults on america's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval . 
the april 2002 instalment of the american war for independence , complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood . 
return to neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company and just another run-of-the-mill disney sequel intended for the home video market . 
it's a thin notion , repetitively stretched out to feature length , awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue . 
the colorful masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of ganesh's rise up the social ladder . 
wimps out by going for that pg-13 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted . 
madonna has made herself over so often now , there's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like michael jackson's nose . 
the story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched . 
it's a bad action movie because there's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring . 
handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism . 
scooby-doo doesn't know if it wants to be a retro-refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly , nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick . 
highly uneven and inconsistent . . . margarita happy hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within . 
the sum of all fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it's really nothing more than warmed-over cold war paranoia . 
represents the depths to which the girls-behaving-badly film has fallen . 
jam-packed with literally bruising jokes . every five minutes or so , someone gets clocked . 
any chekhov is better than no chekhov , but it would be a shame if this was your introduction to one of the greatest plays of the last 100 years . 
lazy , miserable and smug . this is one of the biggest disappointments of the year . 
every visual joke is milked , every set-up obvious and lengthy , every punchline predictable . there's no energy . 
after the setup , the air leaks out of the movie , flattening its momentum with about an hour to go . 
at three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue . 
a crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright craig lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his prelude to a kiss . 
if you recognize zeus ( the dog from snatch ) it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one . 
this is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , 'ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . '
plays like a checklist of everything rob reiner and his cast were sending up . 
it's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness . 
a cross between blow and boyz n the hood , this movie strives to be more , but doesn't quite get there . good performances keep it from being a total rehash . 
troll the cult section of your local video store for the real deal . 
elmo touts his drug as being 51 times stronger than coke . if you're looking for a tale of brits behaving badly , watch snatch again . it's 51 times better than this . 
despite its promising cast of characters , big trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that 'zany' doesn't necessarily mean 'funny . '
does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny . 
just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting . there are a few modest laughs , but certainly no thrills . 
there's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film's simple title . 
a preposterous , prurient whodunit . 
boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory , impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie . 
predictable and cloying , though brown sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle . 
the film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own . 
muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for kevin costner . 
just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that's neither original nor terribly funny . 
at least it's a fairly impressive debut from the director , charles stone iii . 
wanker goths are on the loose ! run for your lives ! 
a grating , emaciated flick . 
presents a good case while failing to provide a reason for us to care beyond the very basic dictums of human decency . 
 . . . unbearably lame . 
the animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from bambi and the lion king , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies . 
steve oedekerk is , alas , no woody allen . 
an amalgam of the fugitive , blade runner , and total recall , only without much energy or tension . 
shows that jackie chan is getting older , and that's something i would rather live in denial about
alas , the black-and-white archival footage of their act showcases pretty mediocre shtick . 
this is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks . 
much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché . 
mark wahlberg . . . may look classy in a '60s-homage pokepie hat , but as a character he's dry , dry , dry . 
the irony is that this film's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own . 
if ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter , this is it . if ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it . 
sandra bullock's best dramatic performance to date ( is ) almost enough to lift ( this ) thrill-kill cat-and-mouser . . . above its paint-by-numbers plot . 
adolescents will be adequately served by the movie's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a 'topless tutorial service . '
the picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment . 
slap me , i saw this movie . 
behind the glitz , hollywood is sordid and disgusting . quelle surprise ! 
just consider what new best friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay . 
the problems of the people in love in the time of money are hardly specific to their era . they just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way . 
so putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film . 
starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clichés . 
one of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation . 
bland but harmless . 
the movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive . 
five screenwriters are credited with the cliché-laden screenplay ; it seems as if each watered down the version of the one before . 
well made but uninvolving , bloodwork isn't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery . 
the movie's blatant derivativeness is one reason it's so lackluster . 
kids don't mind crappy movies as much as adults , provided there's lots of cute animals and clumsy people . 'snow dogs' has both . 
wobbly senegalese updating of " carmen " which is best for the stunning star turn by djeinaba diop gai
ken russell would love this . in one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of quentin tarantino's climactic shootout — and meat loaf explodes . 
the premise of " abandon " holds promise , . . . but its delivery is a complete mess . 
a little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , monsoon wedding serves mostly to whet one's appetite for the bollywood films . 
the rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer cgi effects . 
the lousy john q all but spits out denzel washington's fine performance in the title role . 
what a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is ! 
opera on film is never satisfactory . the art demands live viewing . the innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen . 
it is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill
it's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay . 
as dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy . 
a low-rent retread of the alien pictures . 
its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche . 
the story has little wit and no surprises . 
what should have been a cutting hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week's issue of variety . 
a little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt . 
[t]his slop doesn't even have potential as a cult film , as it's too loud to shout insults at the screen . 
 . . . may work as an addictive guilty pleasure but the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence . this scarlet's letter is a . . . as in aimless , arduous , and arbitrary . 
the central character isn't complex enough to hold our interest . 
a puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks . 
a little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium . 
the biggest problem with satin rouge is lilia herself . she's a cipher , played by an actress who smiles and frowns but doesn't reveal an inner life . 
what with the incessant lounge music playing in the film's background , you may mistake love liza for an adam sandler chanukah song . 
a potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted . 
she's not yet an actress , not quite a singer . . . 
been there done that . 
a movie like the guys is why film criticism can be considered work . 
even if it made its original release date last fall , it would've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness . 
a loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target . 
a movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture . we can tell what it is supposed to be , but can't really call it a work of art . 
 . . . liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario . too bad . 
unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the reginald hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs . 
this romantic/comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in . 
there's a neat twist , subtly rendered , that could have wrapped things up at 80 minutes , but kang tacks on three or four more endings . 
the actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen . 
if this silly little cartoon can inspire a few kids not to grow up to be greedy bastards , more power to it . 
if there's a heaven for bad movies , deuces wild is on its way . 
what's missing in murder by numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens' deviant behaviour . being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough . 
horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it isn't incomprehensible . 
slackers' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by . 
the movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value . 
little more than a well-mounted history lesson . 
a horrible , 99-minute stink bomb . 
her fans walked out muttering words like " horrible " and " terrible , " but had so much fun dissing the film that they didn't mind the ticket cost . in this case zero . 
sheridan's take on the author's schoolboy memoir . . . is a rather toothless take on a hard young life . 
how i killed my father is one of those art house films that makes you feel like you're watching an iceberg melt -- only it never melts . 
there are a few chuckles , but not a single gag sequence that really scores , and the stars seem to be in two different movies . 
it's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast . 
content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance . 
its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like prophet jack , might have made a point or two regarding life . 
it's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread . 
if swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh . 
the master of disguise may have made a great saturday night live sketch , but a great movie it is not . 
boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect . 
has the marks of a septuagenarian ; it's a crusty treatment of a clever gimmick . 
something must have been lost in the translation . 
in the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses . 
rock's stand-up magic wanes . hopkins , squarely fills the screen . action - mechanical . 
for casual moviegoers who stumble into rules expecting a slice of american pie hijinks starring the kid from dawson's creek , they'll probably run out screaming . 
what puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in britney spears' first movie . 
city by the sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for . but how it washed out despite all of that is the project's prime mystery . 
as a hybrid teen thriller and murder mystery , murder by numbers fits the profile too closely . 
i enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was . 
doesn't deliver a great story , nor is the action as gripping as in past seagal films . 
nicks refuses to let slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy . 
amid the cliché and foreshadowing , cage manages a degree of casual realism . . . that is routinely dynamited by blethyn . 
no cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces wild . 
strictly a 'guy's film' in the worst sense of the expression . 
it's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix's . 
we're left with a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments . 
there is nothing redeeming about this movie . 
a dreary indulgence . 
derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone . 
 . . . comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental . 
a film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , waiting for happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact . 
tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often . 
zigzag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted . 
how can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ? in truth , it has all the heart of a porno flick ( but none of the sheer lust ) . 
episode ii-- attack of the clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight . 
[denis'] bare-bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture than the finished product . 
viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some freudian puppet . 
the mantra behind the project seems to have been 'it's just a kids' flick . ' translation : 'we don't need to try very hard . '
it takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what tuck everlasting is about . so here it is : it's about a family of sour immortals . 
the author's devotees will probably find it fascinating ; others may find it baffling . 
there's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces . 
lush and beautifully photographed ( somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book ) , but ultimately you'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered . 
cold , sterile and lacking any color or warmth . 
seems like someone going through the motions . 
wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message at times , and has a visual flair that waxes poetic far too much for our taste . 
wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy , but it isn't as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited . 
one sloughs one's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot . 
it's a fanboy 'what if ? ' brought to life on the big screen . 
it's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it doesn't offer any insights that haven't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid-'90s . 
a few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and jordan brady's direction is prosaic . 
would've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film's predictable denouement . then nadia's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all . 
nair just doesn't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy . 
it's the funniest american comedy since graffiti bridge . 
what starts off as a possible argentine american beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers . 
in old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , ms . shreve's novel proved too difficult a text to 'lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast . 
stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little * * * * . no cute factor here… . not that i mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise . 
a really funny fifteen-minute short stretched beyond its limits to fill an almost feature-length film . 
it is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment . 
a work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse . 
while this film has an 'a' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love . 
most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river . 
 " i blame all men for war , " [the warden's daughter] tells her father . the movie is about as deep as that sentiment . 
i've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but lil bow wow takes the cake . 
for all the complications , it's all surprisingly predictable . 
if deuces wild had been tweaked up a notch it would have become a camp adventure , one of those movies that's so bad it starts to become good . but it wasn't . 
 . . . a low rate annie featuring some kid who can't act , only echoes of jordan , and weirdo actor crispin glover screwing things up old school . 
the picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male all about eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain . 
a nearly 21/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent . 
it looks much more like a cartoon in the end than the simpsons ever has . 
doesn't really add up to much . 
an entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots . 
borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion . 
a chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece . . . so dull that its tagline should be : 'in space , no one can hear you snore . '
sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours . 
everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized . 
the movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers . 
it's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch . 
a fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down . 
there's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age/coming-out tale . 
the type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the [teen comedy] genre a bad name . 
plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of tv's dawson's creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of love story . 
when the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read 'seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . '
a " home alone " film that is staged like " rosemary's baby , " but is not as well-conceived as either of those films . 
no film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population . 
they're going through the motions , but the zip is gone . 
a low-budget affair , tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction . then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed . 
the movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the " webcast . " 
gets the look and the period trappings right , but it otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clichés . 
anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity . 
the problem with the bread , my sweet is that it's far too sentimental . 
falls short in explaining the music and its roots . 
what might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of woody allen or mel brooks ( at least during their '70s heyday ) comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature . 
pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two . 
a supernatural mystery that doesn't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama . it ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors . 
it is so earnest , so overwrought and so wildly implausible that it begs to be parodied . 
swimfan , like fatal attraction , eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub . 
purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons . 
almost everything about the film is unsettling , from the preposterous hairpiece worn by lai's villainous father to the endless action sequences . 
it follows the blair witch formula for an hour , in which we're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes . 
phoned-in business as usual . 
what little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting , macabre sets , and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else . 
tartakovsky's team has some freakish powers of visual charm , but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality . 
god is great , the movie's not . 
when in doubt , the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack , throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip . or else a doggie winks . 
as original and insightful as last week's episode of behind the music . 
you may be galled that you've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie . 
despite the surface attractions -- conrad l . hall's cinematography will likely be nominated for an oscar next year -- there's something impressive and yet lacking about everything . 
[crystal and de niro] manage to squeeze out some good laughs but not enough to make this silly con job sing . 
the christ allegory doesn't work because there is no foundation for it
it's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress . 
i didn't find much fascination in the swinging . what they're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge . but that they are doing it is thought-provoking . 
after collateral damage , you might imagine that most every aggrieved father cliché has been unturned . but no . 
releasing a film with the word 'dog' in its title in january lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and snow dogs deserves every single one of them . 
it was a dark and stormy night . . . 
this sort of cute and cloying material is far from zhang's forte and it shows . 
freundlich's made [crudup] a suburban architect , and a cipher . 
though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it's exploitive without being insightful . 
what starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points . 
seagal is painfully foolish in trying to hold onto what's left of his passe' chopsocky glory . 
the story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin . 
while american adobo has its heart ( and its palate ) in the right place , its brain is a little scattered -- ditsy , even . 
imagine a film that begins as a seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of the shining , the thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s . 
costner's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as shadyac's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink laurence olivier . 
directed by kevin bray , whose crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude with acting , tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut . 
robin williams departs from his fun friendly demeanor in exchange for a darker unnerving role . 
set in a 1986 harlem that doesn't look much like anywhere in new york . 
long on twinkly-eyed close-ups and short on shame . 
a well-crafted letdown . 
deserving of its critical backlash and more . 
neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment . still , it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered . 
the movie spends more time with schneider than with newcomer mcadams , even though her performance is more interesting ( and funnier ) than his . 
it recycles every cliché about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera . 
may offend viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor . 
it aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one . 
if you're not fans of the adventues of steve and terri , you should avoid this like the dreaded king brown snake . personally , i'd rather watch them on the animal planet . 
feels as if the inmates have actually taken over the asylum . 
the movie's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself doesn't stand a ghost of a chance . 
the exclamation point seems to be the only bit of glee you'll find in this dreary mess . 
godard's ode to tackling life's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess . . . in praise of love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that's unfocused and tediously exasperating . 
the movie's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase 'fatal script error . '
more tiring than anything . 
 . . . the efforts of its star , kline , to lend some dignity to a dumb story are for naught . 
isn't it a bit early in his career for director barry sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself ? and it's a lousy one at that . 
i'll go out on a limb . it isn't quite one of the worst movies of the year . it's just merely very bad . 
about amy's cuteness , amy's career success ( she's a best-selling writer of self-help books who can't help herself ) , and amy's neuroses when it comes to men . 
feels aimless for much of its running time , until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives , leaving questions in its wake . 
in my own very humble opinion , in praise of love lacks even the most fragmented charms i have found in almost all of his previous works . 
muddled , simplistic and more than a little pretentious . 
a disaster of a drama , saved only by its winged assailants . 
director elie chouraqui , who co-wrote the script , catches the chaotic horror of war , but why bother if you're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera ? 
if there was any doubt that peter o'fallon didn't have an original bone in his body , a rumor of angels should dispel it . 
what could have been right at home as a nifty plot line in steven soderbergh's traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination . 
this pathetic junk is barely an hour long . nevertheless , it still seems endless . 
dolman confines himself to shtick and sentimentality -- the one bald and the other sloppy . 
it's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much norma rae and not enough pretty woman . 
the script ? please . 
not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired . 
plays like the old disease-of-the-week small-screen melodramas . 
the truth about charlie is that it's a brazenly misguided project . 
displays the potential for a better movie than what bailly manages to deliver
an awkward hybrid of genres that just doesn't work . 
snipes is both a snore and utter tripe . 
chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly . 
rosenthal ( halloween ii ) seems to have forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense . 
rodriguez . . . was unable to reproduce the special spark between the characters that made the first film such a delight . 
some body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling . 
apparently , romantic comedy with a fresh point of view just doesn't figure in the present hollywood program . 
depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived . only masochistic moviegoers need apply . 
what's next ? rob schneider , dana carvey and sarah michelle gellar in the philadelphia story ? david spade as citizen kane ? 
the problem , amazingly enough , is the screenplay . 
upper west sidey exercise in narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute . 
i can't say this enough : this movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies . 
after a while , the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through the country bears is to ponder how a whole segment of pop-music history has been allowed to get wet , fuzzy and sticky . 
summer's far too fleeting to squander on offal like this .

a little objectivity could have gone a long way . 
i believe silberling had the best intentions here , but he just doesn't have the restraint to fully realize them .

[the film's] taste for " shock humor " will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of tom green and the farrelly brothers . 
if legendary shlockmeister ed wood had ever made a movie about a vampire , it probably would look a lot like this alarming production , adapted from anne rice's novel the vampire chronicles . 
interminably bleak , to say nothing of boring . 
it's difficult to discern if this is a crazy work of disturbed genius or merely 90 minutes of post-adolescent electra rebellion . 
the camera whirls ! the camera twirls ! oh , look at that clever angle ! wow , a jump cut ! 
the action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if kaos hadn't blown them all up . 
it puts washington , as honest working man john q . archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher . 
far more enjoyable than its predecessor . 
full frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre's definitive , if disingenuous , feature . 
this rough trade punch-and-judy act didn't play well then and it plays worse now . 
the three leads produce adequate performances , but what's missing from this material is any depth of feeling . 
this painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications . . . that have no bearing on the story . 
has its moments , but it's pretty far from a treasure . 
collateral damage offers formula payback and the big payoff , but the explosions tend to simply hit their marks , pyro-correctly .

an even more predictable , cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor . 
the film doesn't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes wilco a big deal . 
no , i don't know why steven seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money . 
one well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing . proof of this is ballistic : ecks vs . sever .

there isn't one moment in the film that surprises or delights . 
the movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors' moments . 
this movie , a certain scene in particular , brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch .

the lousy lead performances . . . keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired . 
[creates] the worst kind of mythologizing , the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama . 
earnest and heartfelt but undernourished and plodding . 
romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . they cheapen the overall effect . 
an acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald's , let alone some savvy street activism . 
an exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound . 
not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans . 
watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when carol kane appears on the screen . 
fairly run-of-the-mill . 
the film has a nearly terminal case of the cutes , and it's neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is . 
it's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt miramax felt they owed to benigni . 
mildly entertaining . 
a listless sci-fi comedy in which eddie murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect . 
little more than a super-sized infomercial for the cable-sports channel and its summer x games . 
a generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it isn't merely offensive . 
an unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled 'hip' , 'innovative' and 'realistic' . 
 . curiously , super troopers suffers because it doesn't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length . 
i was sent a copyof this film to review on dvd . for free . i still want my money back . 
it's hard to believe that a relationship like holly and marina's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive . 
…passable enough for a shoot-out in the o . k . court house of life type of flick . strictly middle of the road . 
after the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichés , depression and bad alternative music . 
a very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel . 
 " feardotcom " has the makings of an interesting meditation on the ethereal nature of the internet and the otherworldly energies it could channel , but it simply becomes a routine shocker .

formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip .

disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel . 
anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy . 
they presume their audience won't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes .

obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque . 
michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously . 
potty-mouthed enough for pg-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as south park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults . 
a distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour .

the milieu is wholly unconvincing . . . and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch . 
each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time .

mattei so completely loses himself to the film's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , love in the time of money . 
holland lets things peter out midway , but it's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals . 
there's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale . 
it's unfortunate that wallace , who wrote gibson's braveheart as well as the recent pearl harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue . 
dreary tale of middle-class angst

an uplifting drama . . . what antwone fisher isn't , however , is original . 
certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , eight crazy nights is a total misfire . 
showtime isn't particularly assaultive , but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again . 
this tuxedo . . . should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations . 
been there , done that . . . a thousand times already , and better . 
sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness . 
barrels along at the start before becoming mired in sentimentality . 
the kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics . 
at once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavy-handed in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance .

the problematic characters and overly convenient plot twists foul up shum's good intentions .

with its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s . 
loud , silly , stupid and pointless . 
a yawn-provoking little farm melodrama . 
crummy

 " abandon " will leave you wanting to abandon the theater . 
a live-action cartoon , a fast-moving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action put together with the preteen boy in mind . 
what the audience feels is exhaustion , from watching a movie that is dark ( dark green , to be exact ) , sour , bloody and mean . 
dodgy mixture of cutesy romance , dark satire and murder mystery . 
time of favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation . 
while serving sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest austin powers extravaganza , there's nothing here to match that movie's intermittent moments of inspiration . 
the only reason you should see this movie is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow . 
as with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else .

ritchie may not have a novel thought in his head , but he knows how to pose madonna .

an opportunity missed . 
' . . . the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well . . . but quite frankly , scoob and shag don't eat enough during the film . '
tv skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen . 
if there was ever a movie where the upbeat ending feels like a copout , this is the one .

wishy-washy . 
screenwriter dan schneider and director shawn levy substitute volume and primary colors for humor and bite . 
that such a horrible movie could have sprung from such a great one is one of the year's worst cinematic tragedies . 
rarely has a film's title served such dire warning . 
the animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , but jonah . . . never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment . 
mr . wollter and ms . seldhal give strong and convincing performances , but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear . 
in his role of observer of the scene , lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature . 
the film didn't convince me that calvin jr . 's barbershop represents some sort of beacon of hope in the middle of chicago's south side . 
despite some comic sparks , welcome to collinwood never catches fire . 
shows moments of promise but ultimately succumbs to cliches and pat storytelling . 
some body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves .

for dance completists only . 
spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations
the locale . . . remains far more interesting than the story at hand . 
inconsequential road-and-buddy pic . 
this little film is so slovenly done , so primitive in technique , that it can't really be called animation . 
hawke's film , a boring , pretentious waste of nearly two hours , doesn't tell you anything except that the chelsea hotel today is populated by whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes . 
real-life strongman ahola lacks the charisma and ability to carry the film on his admittedly broad shoulders . 
low comedy doesn't come much lower .

a loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy . 
insufferably naive .

a fairly harmless but ultimately lifeless feature-length afterschool special . 
ill-considered , unholy hokum .

one long , numbing action sequence made up mostly of routine stuff yuen has given us before . 
the film's most improbable feat ? it didn't go straight to video . 
the chateau . . . is less concerned with cultural and political issues than doting on its eccentric characters .

about as original as a gangster sweating bullets while worrying about a contract on his life . 
we could have expected a little more human being , and a little less product . 
whether quitting will prove absorbing to american audiences is debatable .

the film never finds its tone and several scenes run too long . 
van wilder has a built-in audience , but only among those who are drying out from spring break and are still unconcerned about what they ingest . 
it's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby . 
the major problem with windtalkers is that the bulk of the movie centers on the wrong character . 
so verbally flatfooted and so emotionally predictable or bland that it plays like the standard made-for-tv movie . 
stale and clichéd to a fault . 
watching junk like this induces a kind of abstract guilt , as if you were paying dues for good books unread , fine music never heard . 
starts off witty and sophisticated and you want to love it -- but filmmaker yvan attal quickly writes himself into a corner . 
unfortunately , contrived plotting , stereotyped characters and woo's over-the-top instincts as a director undermine the moral dilemma at the movie's heart . 
when 'science fiction' takes advantage of the fact that its intended audience hasn't yet had much science , it does a disservice to the audience and to the genre . 
represents something very close to the nadir of the thriller/horror genre . 
as a feature-length film , it wears out its welcome as tryingly as the title character . 
a sleep-inducing thriller with a single twist that everyone except the characters in it can see coming a mile away . 
it's just rather leaden and dull .

instead of trying to bust some blondes , [diggs] should be probing why a guy with his talent ended up in a movie this bad . 
de ayala is required to supply too much of the energy in a film that is , overall , far too staid for its subject matter . 
there's surely something wrong with a comedy where the only belly laughs come from the selection of outtakes tacked onto the end credits . 
the leads we are given here are simply too bland to be interesting . 
adam sandler's 8 crazy nights is 75 wasted minutes of sandler as the voice-over hero in columbia pictures' perverse idea of an animated holiday movie . 
even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of job to get through this interminable , shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture . 
a singularly off-putting romantic comedy . 
it all comes down to whether you can tolerate leon barlow . i can't . 
check your brain and your secret agent decoder ring at the door because you don't want to think too much about what's going on . the movie does has some entertainment value - how much depends on how well you like chris rock . 
a culture clash comedy only half as clever as it thinks it is . 
as self-aware movies go , who is cletis tout ? is clever enough , though thin writing proves its undoing .

a weird little movie that's amusing enough while you watch it , offering fine acting moments and pungent insights into modern l . a . 's show-biz and media subcultures . but it doesn't leave you with much . 
like mike is a slight and uninventive movie : like the exalted michael jordan referred to in the title , many can aspire but none can equal . 
always destined to be measured against anthony asquith's acclaimed 1952 screen adaptation . 
there's some outrageously creative action in the transporter . . . [b]ut by the time frank parachutes down onto a moving truck , it's just another cartoon with an unstoppable superman . 
from its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast , bartleby squanders as much as it gives out . 
despite the holes in the story and the somewhat predictable plot , moments of the movie caused me to jump in my chair . . . 
once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle . 
[a] slummer . 
[allen's] best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middle-america diversions could ever be . 
an ambitious , guilt-suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting . 
a dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding picture . 
a disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate imax trip . 
this sade is hardly a perverse , dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama . he's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery , and the film seems as deflated as he does . 
it's as if a bored cage spent the duration of the film's shooting schedule waiting to scream : " got aids yet ? " 
the film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , underrehearsed , arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo . 
a clash between the artificial structure of the story and the more contemporary , naturalistic tone of the film . . . 
the movie's messages are quite admirable , but the story is just too clichéd and too often strains credulity . 
the script was reportedly rewritten a dozen times -- either 11 times too many or else too few . 
to the filmmakers , ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there's no indication that he's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit . 
it's as if allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself . 
a movie that the less charitable might describe as a castrated cross between highlander and lolita . 
there's little to recommend snow dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity . 
the film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- it's insanely violent and very graphic . 
here the love scenes all end in someone screaming . maybe there's a metaphor here , but figuring it out wouldn't make trouble every day any better .

it goes on for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots . 
you . . . get a sense of good intentions derailed by a failure to seek and strike just the right tone . 
it's the movie equivalent of a sweaty old guy in a rain coat shopping for cheap porn . 
the movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating . 
director yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we haven't seen 10 , 000 times . 
a pint-sized 'goodfellas' designed to appeal to the younger set , it's not a very good movie in any objective sense , but it does mostly hold one's interest . 
while the material is slight , the movie is better than you might think . 
sheridan seems terrified of the book's irreverent energy , and scotches most of its élan , humor , bile , and irony . 
there are more shots of children smiling for the camera than typical documentary footage which hurts the overall impact of the film . it's makes a better travelogue than movie . 
it's as if solondz had two ideas for two movies , couldn't really figure out how to flesh either out , so he just slopped ‘em together here . 
it's a long way from orwell's dark , intelligent warning cry [1984] to the empty stud knockabout of equilibrium , and what once was conviction is now affectation . 
the holiday message of the 37-minute santa vs . the snowman leaves a lot to be desired . 
if you saw it on tv , you'd probably turn it off , convinced that you had already seen that movie . 
if this is cinema , i pledge allegiance to cagney and lacey . 
most of the characters come off as pantomimesque sterotypes . 
while there's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans ( as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo's dumbed-down tactics ) , much ado about something is an amicable endeavor . 
most of the film feels conceived and shot on the fly -- like between lunch breaks for shearer's radio show and his simpson voice-overs . 
culkin turns his character into what is basically an anti-harry potter -- right down to the gryffindor scarf . 
it's a documentary that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good . 
an intriguing near-miss . 
like most movies about the pitfalls of bad behavior . . . circuit gets drawn into the party . 
beneath the uncanny , inevitable and seemingly shrewd facade of movie-biz farce . . . lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments . 
piccoli's performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm's-length in the film seem irritatingly transparent . 
nicolas cage isn't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and this movie won't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career . 
the result is good gossip , entertainingly delivered , yet with a distinctly musty odour , its expiry date long gone . 
all analyze that proves is that there is really only one movie's worth of decent gags to be gleaned from the premise .

if you are into splatter movies , then you will probably have a reasonably good time with the salton sea . 
the feature-length stretch . . . strains the show's concept . 
a film that will probably please people already fascinated by behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration . 
the densest distillation of roberts' movies ever made . 
a handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on pbs than a night out at an amc . 
 ( it ) highlights not so much the crime lord's messianic bent , but spacey's . 
a reworking of die hard and cliffhanger but it's nowhere near as exciting as either . 
a film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity . 
spirit is a visual treat , and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards , but it lacks a strong narrative . 
this is a children's film in the truest sense . it's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so it's great for the kids . parents , on the other hand , will be ahead of the plot at all times , and there isn't enough clever innuendo to fil
tykwer's surface flash isn't just a poor fit with kieslowski's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything kieslowski's work aspired to , including the condition of art . 
too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility . 
what ensues are much blood-splattering , mass drug-induced bowel evacuations , and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between americans and brits . 
visually exciting sci-fi film which suffers from a lackluster screenplay . 
if the full monty was a freshman fluke , lucky break is [cattaneo] sophomore slump . 
allegiance to chekhov , which director michael cacoyannis displays with somber earnestness in the new adaptation of the cherry orchard , is a particularly vexing handicap . 
the first mistake , i suspect , is casting shatner as a legendary professor and kunis as a brilliant college student--where's pauly shore as the rocket scientist ? 
replacing john carpenter's stylish tracking shots is degraded , handheld blair witch video-cam footage . of all the halloween's , this is the most visually unappealing . 
despite its dry wit and compassion , the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing . 
attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama . he seems to want both , but succeeds in making neither . 
it's not a bad plot ; but , unfortunately , the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from . 
girlfriends are bad , wives are worse and babies are the kiss of death in this bitter italian comedy . 
the film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances , but the result is disappointing . 
unfortunately , neither sendak nor the directors are particularly engaging or articulate . 
bang ! zoom ! it's actually pretty funny , but in all the wrong places . 
a wannabe comedy of manners about a brainy prep-school kid with a mrs . robinson complex founders on its own preciousness -- and squanders its beautiful women . 
if anything , see it for karen black , who camps up a storm as a fringe feminist conspiracy theorist named dirty dick . 
this is surely one of the most frantic , virulent and foul-natured christmas season pics ever delivered by a hollywood studio . 
a porn film without the sex scenes . 
a depressingly retrograde , 'post-feminist' romantic comedy that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women . 
by the end , you just don't care whether that cold-hearted snake petrovich ( that would be reno ) gets his comeuppance . just bring on the battle bots , please ! 
broder's screenplay is shallow , offensive and redundant , with pitifully few real laughs . 
don michael paul uses quick-cuts , ( very ) large shadows and wide-angle shots taken from a distance to hide the liberal use of a body double ( for seagal ) . 
the sweetest thing leaves a bitter taste . 
for something as splendid-looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets [sci-fi] rehash . 
this stuck pig of a movie flails limply between bizarre comedy and pallid horror . 
in moonlight mile , no one gets shut out of the hug cycle . 
done in mostly by a weak script that can't support the epic treatment . 
slap her - she's not funny ! no french people were harmed during the making of this movie , but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half . 
 " one look at a girl in tight pants and big tits and you turn stupid ? " um… . . isn't that the basis for the entire plot ? 
strident and inelegant in its 'message-movie' posturing . 
it has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material . 
seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director's experiment is a successful one . 
i suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the dvd . 
ninety minutes of viva castro ! can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of jesse helms' anti- castro rhetoric , which are included
it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller . 
hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired . 
it reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it . 
a great script brought down by lousy direction . same guy with both hats . big mistake . 
director kevin bray excels in breaking glass and marking off the " miami vice " checklist of power boats , latin music and dog tracks . he doesn't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show's trademark style and flash . 
the spalding gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy . 
according to wendigo , 'nature' loves the members of the upper class almost as much as they love themselves . 
the romance between the leads isn't as compelling or as believable as it should be . 
supposedly authentic account of a historical event that's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment . 
to blandly go where we went 8 movies ago . . . 
this u-boat doesn't have a captain . 
this one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit . 
i walked away not really know who " they " were , what " they " looked like . why " they " were here and what " they " wanted and quite honestly , i didn't care . 
after several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of jerry bruckheimer productions , especially because half past dead is like the rock on a wal-mart budget . 
the country bears wastes an exceptionally good idea . but the movie that doesn't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences
 . . . you can be forgiven for realizing that you've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already . 
it's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another . 
the movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as jules verne's '20 , 000 leagues under the sea' and the george pal version of h . g . wells' 'the time machine . ' but its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless . 
even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other bullock and grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene . what should have been a painless time-killer becomes instead a grating endurance test . 
 . . little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic . 
the master of disguise is awful . it's pauly shore awful . don't say you weren't warned . 
the entire movie is filled with deja vu moments . 
what [frei] gives us . . . is a man who uses the damage of war -- far more often than the warfare itself -- to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows . 
the film is way too full of itself ; it's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-oscar kind of way . 
watching " ending " is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor's garage sale . you can't believe anyone would really buy this stuff . 
it desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time . 
from the choppy editing to the annoying score to 'special effects' by way of replacing objects in a character's hands below the camera line , " besotted " is misbegotten
a film that presents an interesting , even sexy premise then ruins itself with too many contrivances and goofy situations . 
directed in a flashy , empty sub-music video style by a director so self-possessed he actually adds a period to his first name
an unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously . 
harvard man is a semi-throwback , a reminiscence without nostalgia or sentimentality . 
while hoffman's performance is great , the subject matter goes nowhere . 
deuces wild treads heavily into romeo and juliet/west side story territory , where it plainly has no business going . 
theological matters aside , the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues . 
novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama . 
the film is all over the place , really . it dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum . 
the action quickly sinks into by-the-numbers territory . 
when [reno] lets her radical flag fly , taking angry potshots at george w . bush , henry kissinger , larry king , et al . , reno devolves into a laugh-free lecture . 
burns' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off . 
while this one gets off with a good natured warning , future lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter
too much of the movie feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story wouldn't work without all those gimmicks . 
the ethos of the chelsea hotel may shape hawke's artistic aspirations , but he hasn't yet coordinated his own dv poetry with the beat he hears in his soul . 
why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ? 
exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as kerrigan's platinum-blonde hair . 
all mood and no movie . 
simone is not a bad film . it just doesn't have anything really interesting to say . 
 . . . hopefully it'll be at the dollar theatres by the time christmas rolls around . wait to see it then . 
lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck . 
death to smoochy tells a moldy-oldie , not-nearly -as-nasty -as-it- thinks-it-is joke . over and over again . 
the film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class . 
entertainment more disposable than hanna-barbera's half-hour cartoons ever were . 
by the end of it all i sort of loved the people onscreen , even though i could not stand them . perhaps the film should be seen as a conversation starter . it's not an easy one to review . 
the whole talking-animal thing is grisly . 
wouldn't it be funny if a bunch of allied soldiers went undercover as women in a german factory during world war ii ? um , no . but here's a movie about it anyway . 
the punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one . but death to smoochy keeps firing until the bitter end . 
showtime's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment . those who trek to the 'plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves . but ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as mr . de niro . 
too daft by half . . . but supremely good natured . 
it's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes . . . finally seem so impersonal or even shallow . 
juliette binoche's sand is vivacious , but it's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile . 
you can tell almost immediately that welcome to collinwood isn't going to jell . 
cattaneo reworks the formula that made the full monty a smashing success . . . but neglects to add the magic that made it all work . 
a rip-off twice removed , modeled after [seagal's] earlier copycat under siege , sometimes referred to as die hard on a boat . 
you can practically hear george orwell turning over . 
while holm is terrific as both men and hjejle quite appealing , the film fails to make the most out of the intriguing premise . 
if it were any more of a turkey , it would gobble in dolby digital stereo . if nothing else , " rollerball " 2002 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by ll cool j . 
how do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ? on the evidence before us , the answer is clear : not easily and , in the end , not well enough . 
more trifle than triumph . 
festers in just such a dungpile that you'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you . 
it sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that's more or less how it plays out . 
report card : doesn't live up to the exalted tagline - there's definite room for improvement . doesn't deserve a passing grade ( even on a curve ) . 
as his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in long time dead says 'i'm telling you , this is f * * * ed' . maybe he was reading the minds of the audience . 
bean drops the ball too many times . . . hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay . 
blood work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood's dirty harry period . 
[lee] treats his audience the same way that jim brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects . and lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception . 
one of the worst movies of the year . . . . watching it was painful . 
no amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting can hide a weak script . 
nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here . 
earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner . 
the exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors . 
even when crush departs from the 4w formula . . . it feels like a glossy rehash . 
bears is even worse than i imagined a movie ever could be . 
this is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives . 
whether it's the worst movie of 2002 , i can't say for sure : memories of rollerball have faded , and i skipped country bears . but this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title . 
not once in the rush to save the day did i become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of 'eh . '
the first question to ask about bad company is why anthony hopkins is in it . we assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low . 
shame on writer/director vicente aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull . 
violent , vulgar and forgettably entertaining . 
with a completely predictable plot , you'll swear that you've seen it all before , even if you've never come within a mile of the longest yard . 
blue crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky " pretty woman " retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought . 
what we get in feardotcom is more like something from a bad clive barker movie . in other words , it's badder than bad . 
a sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like the ghost and mr . chicken . 
where the film falters is in its tone . 
ultimately , sarah's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness . 
feels more like a rejected x-files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening . 
an enigmatic film that's too clever for its own good , it's a conundrum not worth solving . 
rashomon-for-dipsticks tale . 
it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that . 
certainly not a good movie , but it wasn't horrible either . 
the result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel . 
nothing but an episode of smackdown ! in period costume and with a bigger budget . 
while the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible anne rice novel it's based upon , queen of the damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle . 
a good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance . 
if hill isn't quite his generation's don siegel ( or robert aldrich ) , it's because there's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it's all bluster and cliché . 
this is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors . 
`martin lawrence live' is so self-pitying , i almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show . 
never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three . 
does what should seem impossible : it makes serial killer jeffrey dahmer boring . 
 . . . better described as a ghost story gone badly awry . 
the filmmakers are playing to the big boys in new york and l . a . to that end , they mock the kind of folks they don't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers don't care to understand , either . 
the big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing . 
this thing is virtually unwatchable . 
the self-serious equilibrium makes its point too well ; a movie , like life , isn't much fun without the highs and lows . 
the main characters are simply named the husband , the wife and the kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort . 
swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then . 
the characters . . . are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script . 
the trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through . 
a so-so , made-for-tv something posing as a real movie . 
whether this is art imitating life or life imitating art , it's an unhappy situation all around . 
a formula family tearjerker told with a heavy irish brogue . . . accentuating , rather than muting , the plot's saccharine thrust . 
this is as lax and limp a comedy as i've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material . 
the sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset . 
a preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in brooklyn circa 1958 . 
everything its title implies , a standard-issue crime drama spat out from the tinseltown assembly line . 
a rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade . 
talkiness isn't necessarily bad , but the dialogue frequently misses the mark . 
the stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny . 
charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past love story derisions . 
no amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story . 
 . . . for all its social and political potential , state property doesn't end up being very inspiring or insightful . 
little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point . . . is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable . 
this is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy . 
overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue
the master of disguise falls under the category of 'should have been a sketch on saturday night live . '
koepp's screenplay isn't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own . 
more successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine
it's hard to pity the 'plain' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss . rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash . 
the drama discloses almost nothing . 
belongs in the too-hot-for-tv direct-to-video/dvd category , and this is why i have given it a one-star rating . 
a dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the animal planet documentary series , crocodile hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring . 
even fans of ismail merchant's work , i suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one . 
it's not a particularly good film , but neither is it a monsterous one . 
enchanted with low-life tragedy and liberally seasoned with emotional outbursts . . . what is sorely missing , however , is the edge of wild , lunatic invention that we associate with cage's best acting . 
sade achieves the near-impossible : it turns the marquis de sade into a dullard . 
one of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies i've ever seen . 
unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making . 
it should be doing a lot of things , but doesn't . 
 . . . a rather bland affair . 
the movie tries to be ethereal , but ends up seeming goofy . 
harris is supposed to be the star of the story , but comes across as pretty dull and wooden . 
a boring masquerade ball where normally good actors , even kingsley , are made to look bad . 
the filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart . 
mariah carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in glitter here in wisegirls . 
i suspect that you'll be as bored watching morvern callar as the characters are in it . if you go , pack your knitting needles . 
some writer dude , i think his name was , uh , michael zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that i ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck . 
this feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head
spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning . 
a period story about a catholic boy who tries to help a jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell . 
proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness . 
some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff . stealing harvard can't even do that much . each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth . 
i spied with my little eye . . . a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits
the satire is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying . 
less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is . 
a feeble tootsie knockoff . 
…the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid . 
an allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals african american professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message . 
one key problem with these ardently christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out . 
a relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty world war ii action flick . 
too long , and larded with exposition , this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community . 
 . . . a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable . 
the histrionic muse still eludes madonna and , playing a charmless witch , she is merely a charmless witch . 
diaz , applegate , blair and posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused . 
an inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more . 
absolutely ( and unintentionally ) terrifying . 
eight legged freaks falls flat as a spoof . 
you'll just have your head in your hands wondering why lee's character didn't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery . 
in his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls . 
veers uncomfortably close to pro-serb propaganda . 
movies like high crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation . how about surprising us by trying something new ? 
throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old world war ii movie for overly familiar material . 
further sad evidence that tom tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning run lola run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap . 
the movie is a little tired ; maybe the original inspiration has run its course . 
a full-frontal attack on audience patience . 
it's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled . 
one gets the impression the creators of don't ask don't tell laughed a hell of a lot at their own jokes . too bad none of it is funny . 
the film , like jimmy's routines , could use a few good laughs . 
purports to be a hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging . oh , and more entertaining , too . 
though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well-acted by james spader and maggie gyllenhaal , i felt disrespected . 
humor in i spy is so anemic . 
a real snooze . 
while the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched stephen norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning david s . goyer is much sillier . 
it shares the first two films' loose-jointed structure , but laugh-out-loud bits are few and far between . 
you cannot guess why the cast and crew didn't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed . 
if you're really renting this you're not interested in discretion in your entertainment choices , you're interested in anne geddes , john grisham , and thomas kincaid . 
the uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them . 
a word of advice to the makers of the singles ward : celebrity cameos do not automatically equal laughs . and neither do cliches , no matter how 'inside' they are . 
its appeal will probably limited to lds church members and undemanding armchair tourists . 
cherish would've worked a lot better had it been a short film . 
hey arnold ! is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation . still , the updated dickensian sensibility of writer craig bartlett's story is appealing . 
doesn't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the sundance film festival two years ago . 
kaufman's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious . 
queen of the damned is too long with too little going on . 
any film that doesn't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss . 
the rules of attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing . 
in this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , and the limited range of a comedian . 
no surprises . 
the high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : there's very little hustling on view . 
characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle . 
it's a movie that ends with truckzilla , for cryin' out loud . if that doesn't clue you in that something's horribly wrong , nothing will . 
it's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 . 
as pedestrian as they come . 
it's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary . 
more intellectually scary than dramatically involving . 
the abiding impression , despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste -- the acres of haute couture can't quite conceal that there's nothing resembling a spine here . 
you come away thinking not only that kate isn't very bright , but that she hasn't been worth caring about and that maybe she , janine and molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another . 
very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all . 
the attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show . 
a cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic ladies and gentlemen , the fabulous stains . . . crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential . 
for this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull sorvino has no light touch , and rodan is out of his league . 
though excessively tiresome , the uncertainty principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore . 
it's tough to be startled when you're almost dozing . 
it's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead . 
there are many definitions of 'time waster' but this movie must surely be one of them . 
the thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie .
